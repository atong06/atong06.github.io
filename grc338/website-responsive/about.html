                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>Dashi and Don were inspired by Mari and Hideo Terao, a local Sacramento couple who would regularly host ramen, udon, or rice bowl gatherings to celebrate their Japanese heritage and to inspire young Japanese Americans to embrace their culture. After decades of hosting these gatherings, the Teraos have since passed down their recipes and techniques to keep their tradition alive. Dashi and Don hope to continue the legacy of Mari and Hideo Terao through the use of their specialty dashi recipe. Dashi is a versatile Japanese soup stock that is the backbone of many soup dishes as well as rice bowl dishes. We hope to not only continue to share food with our community, but we also aspire to spread the same joy and hospitality that the Teraos have given over the years.</p>
