					<h1>Jarhead • About</h1>
				
					<p>Our vision is to help cultivate a modern coffee community. We believe that every person is responsible for how coffee is changing. Whether you're roasting, farming or drinking, we believe that we can create a community that embraces equity, honesty, and quality.</p>
                 
                    <p>We want to create a culture that sees the importance in conversations or experiences that are cultivated over a cup of coffee. Who did you go with? What did you talk about? Or maybe you were taking a solo trip. What headspace were you in? Perhaps you took your coffee to-go. You found yourself in a rush, but not rushed enough to ignore the bliss of our coffee!</p>
                 
                    <p>Established in 2010, Jarhead aspires to bring quality coffee to all types of people—encouraging community with others and the slow paced leisure of sitting in a coffee shop.</p>
